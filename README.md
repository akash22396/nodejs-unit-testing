# Unit Testing in Node.js

The repo for the code lab session of JSLovers meet-up on 17th March 2019! :blush:
The repository contains both the tests using ~~`Mocha`~~<sup>1</sup> and `Jest`, however I prefer Node.js testing using `Mocha` when it comes to `MongoDB` & `Mongoose`

## Agenda

- SDLC
- Testing
- Coding Phase & Unit Testing
- Unit Testing in Node.js
- Test Driven Development
- Code Coverage
- CI/CD (Read the [Guide](Setup-For-CI.md))

## A note on branches

I planned to carry out the workshop in 4 steps. hence you can find 4 extra branches for this repo. Each branch contains the codebase in progressive steps. Codebase is splitted into

- Step 1: Testing Functions
  - Normal Functions
  - Callbacks Functions
  - Promise Functions
  - `async- await` Functions
- Step 2: Testing Classes
- Step 3: How about TDD?
- Step 4: Let's setup CI/CD (Refer this [Guide](Setup-For-CI.md) if you forget the steps)

## Notes

- ~<sup>1</sup>Due to lack of time I dropped the idea of Mocha, let's see when I can publish Mocha stuff~
