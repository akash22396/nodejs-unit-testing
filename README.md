# Unit Testing in Node.js

The repo for the code lab session of JSLovers meet-up on 17th March 2019! :blush:

## Agenda

- SDLC
- Testing
- Coding Phase & Unit Testing
- Unit Testing in Node.js
- Test Driven Development
- Code Coverage
- CI/CD

The repository contains both the tests using `Mocha` and `Jest`, however I prefer Node.js testing using `Mocha` when it comes to `MongoDB`
